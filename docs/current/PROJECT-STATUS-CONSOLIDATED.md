| CompoundStrategy | 0xE1638A...79a | ✅ Active | 15% allocation |

### Performance Metrics

**Portfolio Performance:**

- ✅ Individual strategies tested and functional
- ✅ EnhancedRealYieldStrategy: 12/12 tests passing (100% success)
- ⚠️ PortfolioManager integration: 23/151 tests failing due to MockERC20 dependency issues
- ✅ Core strategy implementations validated and production-ready
- ✅ Emergency controls tested and functional

**Current Test Status:**

- **Overall**: 128 passing, 23 failing (85% success rate)
- **Core Strategy Tests**: Individual strategies working correctly
- **Integration Issues**: PortfolioManager tests blocked by missing MockERC20 contract
- **Production Readiness**: Individual strategies ready, portfolio integration needs debugging

**Risk Management:**

- ✅ Multi-protocol diversification reduces single-point failures
- ✅ Emergency pause mechanisms for individual strategies
- ✅ Comprehensive access controls and security measures
- ✅ Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities
