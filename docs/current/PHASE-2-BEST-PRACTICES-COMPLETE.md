    function totalAssets() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address user) external view returns (uint256);
    function getAPY() external view returns (uint256);
    function getStrategyInfo() external view returns (string memory, string memory, string memory);
}
```

```typescript
// Phase 2 Detection Logic
const isPhase2 = deployments.phase2?.enabled && deployments.phase2?.liveStrategy;

// Conditional Strategy Usage
if (isPhase2) {
    // Use LiveUniswapV3Strategy directly
    const strategy = contractWrapper.createContract(liveStrategyAddress, LiveUniswapV3StrategyABI);
} else {
    // Fall back to legacy vault system
    const vault = contractWrapper.createContract(vaultAddress, VAULT_ABI);
}
```
