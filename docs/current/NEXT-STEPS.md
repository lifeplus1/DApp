# üöÄ NEXT STEPS - Phase 6 Roadmap (Last updated: 2025-09-01)

## üéØ Context

Phase 5.3 (Advanced Analytics & Live Yield) is COMPLETE. The platform now shifts to **Phase 6: Production Launch & Aave Finalization** with emphasis on audit readiness, automation, and risk hardening.

Authoritative status & metrics: `PROJECT-STATUS-CONSOLIDATED.md`.

---

## üß≠ Phase 6 Core Objectives

| Pillar | Objective | Success Criteria | ETA |
|--------|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Strategy Expansion | Integrate & allocate AaveStrategy | Stable 5‚Äì10% allocation passing integration tests | Week 1 |
| Audit Readiness | Finalize invariants + security checklist | All critical invariants scripted & passing | Week 2 |
| Gas & Size | Benchmark hot paths (deposit/redeem/rebalance) | Report + >=15% savings opportunities documented | Week 2 |
| Automation | Docs + address + timestamp CI | CI job passes; zero broken links | Week 1 |
| Observability | Add structured logging + basic health metrics | Error rate panel + latency log fields | Week 2 |
| Frontend Hardening | Edge-case analytics tests | 90%+ coverage for analytics modules | Week 2 |
| Governance | ADR cadence + CHANGELOG discipline | ADR-0002/0003 merged; version tags for releases | Ongoing |
| Launch Prep | Mainnet readiness & rollback plan | Runbook approved & tested | Week 3 |

---

## ÔøΩ Aave Integration Plan

1. Implement `AaveStrategy` borrowing & supply logic (mock rates first)
2. Add unit tests: deposit/withdraw/APY calculation, pause, reentrancy guard
3. Wire into `PortfolioManager` with provisional 5% allocation
4. Run integration rebalancing test matrix (target ¬±0.5% drift tolerance)
5. Promote allocation to target range once stable & gas profile acceptable

Risk Notes: Monitor health factor thresholds; add invariant preventing unsafe collateralization.

---

## üîê Audit Readiness & Security Hardening

| Area | Task | Owner | Status |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | Formalize share accounting, pause enforcement, strategy balance monotonicity | EngSec | PENDING |
| Threat Model | Update `SECURITY-OVERVIEW.md` with Aave-specific risks | EngSec | PENDING |
| Access Control | Review privileged functions & multisig plan | EngSec | PENDING |
| Emergency Runbook | Add rollback & partial withdrawal scenarios | Ops | PENDING |
| Logging | Introduce structured event mapping doc | Eng | PENDING |

Bug Bounty (Preliminary): Draft scope + severity matrix (defer launch until after external audit scheduling).

---

## ‚õΩ Gas & Performance Benchmarking

Targets:

- Reduce median `rebalance()` gas by ‚â•10%
- Verify no regression in `deposit()` or `withdraw()` vs Phase 5.3 baseline
- Produce `GAS-REPORT.md` (automated snapshot) committed weekly

Actions:

1. Enable Hardhat gas reporter (ensure `GAS_REPORT=true`)
2. Add benchmark script: run core flows N=5 & average
3. Document hotspots & candidate optimizations (storage packing, loop bounds, external call batching)

---

## üìö Documentation & Automation Enhancements

| Component | Enhancement | Tooling |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Timestamp Refresh | `docs-automation.sh timestamps` in CI | GitHub Actions |
| Contract Addresses | Auto-regenerate from deployments | `docs-automation.sh addresses` |
| Link Integrity | Basic markdown scan (extend later) | `link-check` command |
| Style Enforcement | Add markdown lint job (future) | markdownlint-cli2 |
| ADR Index | Auto-build ADR list | Simple script (future) |

Add CI workflow `docs.yml` triggering on PR changes touching `/docs/**` or deployments.

---

## üß™ Analytics & Frontend Hardening

Add test modules:

- Edge APY: zero-liquidity, stale subgraph, negative drift scenario
- Volatility window boundaries (1 sample / max window)
- Sharpe ratio divide-by-zero guard
- Responsive layout snapshot tests (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Error boundary recovery for forced network disconnect

Performance Budget:

- Interaction commit <100ms (validate via React Profiler script)
- Re-render count for main dashboard unchanged (< X per refresh cycle)

---

## üìä Metrics & Reporting Cadence

| Metric | Source | Frequency | Owner |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Test Pass Rate | CI | Per PR | Eng |
| Gas Snapshot | Gas reporter | Weekly | Eng |
| Docs Freshness | Timestamp diff | Weekly | Docs |
| Invariant Status | Invariant test suite | Weekly | EngSec |
| Open Security Issues | Issue labels | Weekly | EngSec |

---

## üóÇ Governance & ADR Roadmap

Upcoming ADRs:

1. ADR-0002: Aave Strategy Design
2. ADR-0003: Invariant Testing Framework & Coverage Policy
3. ADR-0004: Gas Benchmarking Methodology

Each ADR: context ‚Üí decision ‚Üí rationale ‚Üí measurable success criteria.
