2. **Automated Portfolio Management** - Dynamic rebalancing and optimization
3. **Advanced Analytics** - ML-powered yield prediction and risk assessment
4. **Enterprise Features** - Institutional-grade tools and compliance

## 🏗️ Phase 3 Architecture Design

### **1. Portfolio Manager Contract**

```solidity
// Phase 3 Core: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Manager
contract PortfolioManager is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    struct StrategyAllocation {
        address strategyAddress;
        uint256 targetPercent;  // Basis points (10000 = 100%)
        uint256 currentAmount;
        uint256 lastRebalance;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(address => StrategyAllocation) public strategies;
    address[] public activeStrategies;
    
    // Core Phase 3 Functions
    function addStrategy(address strategy, uint256 targetPercent) external onlyOwner;
    function rebalancePortfolio() external returns (uint256 gasUsed);
    function calculateOptimalAllocation() external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    function getPortfolioAPY() external view returns (uint256 weightedAPY);
    function emergencyRebalance() external onlyOwner;
}
```

### **2. Strategy Integration Architecture**

#### **Immediate Priority Strategies (Week 1-2):**

```solidity
// Curve Finance Integration
contract CurveStableStrategy is IStrategyV2 {
    function deposit(uint256 amount, address user) external override returns (uint256 shares);
    function getPoolAPY() external view returns (uint256 curveAPY);
    function harvestCRVRewards() external returns (uint256 rewards);
}

// Compound Finance Integration  
contract CompoundV3Strategy is IStrategyV2 {
    function supplyToCompound(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256 cTokens);
    function claimCOMPRewards() external returns (uint256 rewards);
    function getSupplyAPY() external view returns (uint256 compoundAPY);
}
```

#### **Advanced Strategies (Week 3-4):**

```solidity
// Aave Lending Integration
contract AaveV3Strategy is IStrategyV2 {
    function depositToAave(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256 aTokens);
    function harvestAAVERewards() external returns (uint256 rewards);
    function getVariableAPY() external view returns (uint256 aaveAPY);
}

// Liquity Stability Pool
contract LiquityStabilityStrategy is IStrategyV2 {
    function depositToStabilityPool(uint256 amount) external returns (uint256 shares);
    function harvestLQTY() external returns (uint256 rewards);
    function getStabilityAPY() external view returns (uint256 liquityAPY);
}
```

### **3. Advanced Analytics Engine**

```typescript
// Phase 3 Frontend: Portfolio Analytics Dashboard
interface PortfolioAnalytics {
  totalValue: bigint;
  strategyBreakdown: StrategyAllocation[];
  historicalPerformance: YieldDataPoint[];
  riskMetrics: {
    sharpeRatio: number;
    volatility: number;
    maxDrawdown: number;
    riskScore: number;
  };
  rebalanceRecommendations: RebalanceAction[];
  yieldProjections: YieldForecast[];
}

// ML-Powered Yield Prediction
class YieldPredictor {
  async predictOptimalAllocation(): Promise<AllocationStrategy> {
    // TensorFlow.js yield forecasting model
    const historicalData = await this.fetchHistoricalAPYs();
    const marketConditions = await this.analyzeMarketConditions();
    return this.mlModel.predict(historicalData, marketConditions);
  }
}
```
