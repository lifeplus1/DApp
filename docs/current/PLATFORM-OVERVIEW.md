## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Multi-Factor APY Algorithm

```solidity
function getAPY() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 baseAPY = 800; // 8% base
    uint256 volatilityBonus = getVolatilityBonus(); // 0-5%
    uint256 liquidityMiningBonus = getLiquidityMiningBonus(); // 0-4%
    uint256 tradingFeeAPY = getTradingFeeAPY(); // 0-4%
    
    return baseAPY + volatilityBonus + liquidityMiningBonus + tradingFeeAPY;
}
```

### Time-Based Compound Growth

```solidity
function calculateTimeBasedYield(uint256 principal) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeElapsed = block.timestamp - lastUpdateTime;
    uint256 currentAPY = getAPY();
    
    // Compound growth calculation
    return principal * (currentAPY * timeElapsed) / (365 days * 10000);
}
```

### Type-Safe Frontend Integration

```typescript
const { metrics, userBalance, loading, error, actions } = useEnhancedStrategy({
  strategyAddress: deployments.contracts.enhancedStrategy,
  vaultAddress: deployments.contracts.stableVault,
  provider,
  signer: networkSupported ? signer : null
});
```
