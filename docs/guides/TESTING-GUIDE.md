- Loading indicators show during updates
- Data updates smoothly without page refresh
- Error handling works if refresh fails

#### 2. Contract Interaction Test

**Steps:**

1. Ensure Sepolia testnet connection
2. Test deposit function with small amount
3. Test harvest function
4. Test withdraw function
5. Monitor transaction confirmations

**Expected Results:**

- Transaction prompts appear in MetaMask
- Loading states show during pending transactions
- Success messages display after confirmation
- Metrics update automatically after transactions
- Error messages appear for failed transactions
