# ðŸ”’ Security Overview

Consolidated security posture and roadmap for audit readiness.

## Pillars

| Pillar | Implementation | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Access Control | Ownable roles (multisig planned) | Phase 6 upgrade |
| Reentrancy | CEI pattern + OZ ReentrancyGuard | Review external call sites |
| Emergency Controls | Strategy pause mechanisms | Runbook maintained |
| Data Integrity | Subgraph fallback & caching | Add checksum validation |
| Monitoring | Manual logs (automation planned) | Add alerting Phase 6 |

## Emergency Runbook (Summary)

1. Detect anomaly
2. Pause impacted strategy
3. Snapshot balances & events
4. Publish incident note
5. Patch & redeploy (if needed)
6. Resume after validation

## Threat Matrix

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Reentrancy | Guard + CEI |
| Price Manipulation | Diversification & time-weighting |
| Privilege Misuse | Limited admin surface; future multisig |
| Data Outage | Cached responses + fallback mocks |
| Frontend Tampering | Build integrity, type safety |

## Audit Path

| Stage | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Pre-Audit | Invariants + gas profile documented |
| External Audit | Phase 6 scheduling |
| Bug Bounty | Post-audit launch |

## Invariants (Draft)

- Vault share accounting is monotonic w.r.t deposits/withdrawals
- Emergency pause blocks state-mutating strategy calls
- No unbounded loops over user-controlled arrays
