## 🎯 Final Step: Strategy Integration

### Current Status
The infrastructure is complete with both contracts deployed. Only one transaction remains:

```solidity
// Execute this on PortfolioManager at 0x9189d6926e180F77650020f4fF9b4B9efd0a30C9
portfolioManager.addStrategy(
    "0x8CFD4548e9E7cb38cA714B188215019A63E9B90f", // CurveStableStrategy
    4000,                                           // 40% allocation
    "CurveStableStrategy"                          // Strategy name
);
```

### Expected Result
- **60%** allocation to LiveUniswapV3Strategy (Uniswap V3 liquidity)
- **40%** allocation to CurveStableStrategy (Curve 3Pool stable yield)
- **100%** total portfolio allocation ready for user deposits

## 📈 Next Steps After Integration
