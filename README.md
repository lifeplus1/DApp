> **🎯 Platform Scope (Current)**: Phase 5.3 delivered live Uniswap V3 data integration, performance-optimized React component library,  
> and advanced analytics (volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, multi-pool comparison) atop the multi-strategy portfolio  
> (Uniswap / Curve / Compound).  
> **Phase 6 focuses on Aave integration, audit readiness, gas benchmarking, and automation hardening.**

## 🎯 Current Status: PHASE 5.3 COMPLETE ✅ | Preparing Phase 6 (Production Launch & Aave Finalization)

This repository now contains a **Phase 5.3 enterprise-grade DeFi yield & analytics platform** featuring:

- 🏗️ **Multi-Strategy Architecture**: PortfolioManager with automated rebalancing (Uni / Curve / Compound; Aave staging)
- 📊 **Advanced Analytics**: Live yield metrics, volatility, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, pool comparison
- 🧠 **Intelligent Optimization**: Dynamic allocation and performance monitoring
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Security**: Emergency controls, access management, gas optimization
- 🎨 **Optimized React UI**: Performance-tuned component library (memoization, skeleton loading, responsive system)
- 🔒 **Robust Error Handling**: Production error boundaries & resilient data fetching
- ⚡ **Live Data Integration**: Real Uniswap V3 subgraph + caching layer
- 🧪 **Automation & Testing**: Integrated scripts + coverage & analytics reports
