  };
}
```

#### **Deployment Configuration**

```solidity
// Production Deployment Settings
contract ProductionConfig {
    // Gas Optimization
    uint256 constant GAS_LIMIT = 500000;
    uint256 constant GAS_PRICE_BUFFER = 20; // 20% buffer
    
    // Security Settings
    bool constant MAINNET_SECURITY_MODE = true;
    uint256 constant EMERGENCY_PAUSE_THRESHOLD = 24 hours;
    
    // Performance Settings
    uint256 constant MAX_STRATEGIES = 10;
    uint256 constant REBALANCE_COOLDOWN = 4 hours;
    uint256 constant HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 5 minutes;
}
```
